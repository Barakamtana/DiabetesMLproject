The notebook in this Repo is the 2nd my second merriSKILL project.

Through the project I was able to learn machine learning techniques and how to apply them in real life scenarios

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict
whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of
these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
